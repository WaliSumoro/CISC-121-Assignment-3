AI helped me pressure‑test edge cases and suggested the dict+set rewrite, but I verified correctness by hand‑tracing short adversarial strings like \"(]\", \"([)]\", \"((\", and \"\". I also made a deliberate design call on what to do with non‑bracket characters and documented it inline. The final version is shorter, safer, and easier to reason about than the draft, and I can justify each branch during a viva or code review."
